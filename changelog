* changed table_name to __table_name__, read_repair_chance to __read_repair_chance__, keyspace to __keyspace__
* modified table name auto generator to ignore module name
* changed internal implementation of model value get/set
* added TimeUUID.from_datetime(), used for generating UUID1's for a specific
